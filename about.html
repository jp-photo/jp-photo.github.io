    <h3>"My name is Jacob Purdy and I am a young artist, photographer, model, actor and designer. I had the opportunity to study in the Montessori school system at an early age and have credited that experience for a portion of my creative ability. From childhood to teen years, I took a lot of inspiration for my work from my recurring nightmares and used my art to introspectively contemplate what I was experiencing. Towards young adulthood and the present, I’ve found my artwork to be expressive of inner vulnerability, honesty and integrity between peoples and myself. My photography hopes to elucidate the cultural and personal identity of the individual I am photographing, through fashion and emotion. Through my modeling I choose to show my own vulnerabilities visually through form."
